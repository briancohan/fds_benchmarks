# FDS Benchmarks

As part of the SFPE Advanced Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) course, students were asked to run a number of models to see the effect of mesh resolution and MP Threads on simulation time.
This repo provides an exploration of the results.

The original data can be found in this [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RgDj0EAtFC8vVzdeue0ylMd3vPxi-Oxj43dIZpr__Sk/).
The data is also retained in the `data` directory of this repository.
The FDS files used are provided in the `data` directory as well.

The `benchmark` directory contains modules to help keep the appearance of the [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) clean.

Click [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/briancohan/fds_benchmarks/HEAD?filepath=Explore.ipynb) to explore the binder interactively (this may take a few moments to start).
